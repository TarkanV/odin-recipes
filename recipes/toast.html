    <h3>Golden Sunrise French Toast will be a treat your family will love! The golden crisp goodness of this hearty morning favorite is made with thick-sliced French bread infused with a hint of vanilla and topped with fresh seasonal fruit - then drizzled with maple syrup for the perfect start to a special morning.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 can (12 fluid ounces) NESTLÉ® CARNATION® Evaporated Lowfat 2% Milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 to 10 slices (3/4-inch-thick) firm, day-old French bread</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
